# Sentence Embedding and Summarization with Faiss and Facebook BERT

This repository contains code for a text processing pipeline that tokenizes text using the NLTK library, applies Sentence Bert embeddings to capture contextual meaning, uses Faiss to find similar sentences related to a provided query, and summarizes these sentences using the Facebook BERT model.

## Introduction

In this project, we have implemented a text processing pipeline that consists of the following steps:

1. **Tokenization:** We use the NLTK library to tokenize input text into sentences.

2. **Embedding:** We apply the Sentence Bert embedding technique to capture the contextual meaning of sentences.

3. **Similarity Search:** We utilize the Faiss technique to efficiently find sentences similar to a provided query based on their embeddings.

4. **Summarization:** We summarize the similar sentences using the Facebook BERT model to generate concise and meaningful summaries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Sentence Bert
- Faiss
- Hugging Face Transformers (for Facebook BERT)

You can install these dependencies using pip.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
